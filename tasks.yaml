  # P0 - Ordinal Handling (Revisit)
  - id: ordinal_loss_revisit
    description: Revisit Ordinal Loss Implementation (e.g., XGBRanker, CatBoost YetiRank)
    priority: P0
    notes: Initial 'rank:pairwise' attempt failed. Need alternative approach like XGBRanker or external libraries.

  # P1 - Classical Pipeline Tuning
  - id: focal_loss
    description: Implement Focal Loss (Custom XGBoost or LightGBM)
    priority: P1
    notes: Helps focus on hard-to-classify examples, potentially better than simple class weights.
  - id: custom_class_weights
    description: Apply Custom Class Weights (Focus on class 1 recall)
    priority: P1
    notes: Alternative/complement to focal loss, targeting specific recall issues.

  # P2 - Richer Temporal Features
  - id: richer_lags
    description: Engineer Richer Lag Features (exp-decay mean, volatility, inter-arrival, session features)
    priority: P2
    notes: Add exponential decay lags, inter-arrival times, session info (daily reset, weekend), bust volatility.
  - id: hmm_regime_flag
    description: Add Hidden-Markov Model Regime Flag Feature (2-state on volatility)
    priority: P2
    notes: Capture potential calm/wild market phases.
  - id: shap_interactions
    description: Add SHAP-guided Feature Interaction Terms
    priority: P2
    notes: Run SHAP analysis once to identify and explicitly add important pairwise interactions.

  # P3 - Sequence Models Exploration
  - id: explore_tcn
    description: Prototype Sequence Model (Temporal Convolutional Network)
    priority: P3
    notes: Handles long receptive field, potentially better accuracy (target 55-57%).
  - id: explore_gru_lstm
    description: Prototype Sequence Model (GRU/LSTM)
    priority: P3
    notes: Baseline recurrent model approach.
  - id: explore_transformer
    description: Prototype Sequence Model (Small Transformer Encoder)
    priority: P3
    notes: Capture periodicity/regimes via self-attention.

  # P4 - Reinforcement Learning Policy
  - id: explore_rl
    description: Explore RL Policy for Bet Sizing/Skipping (C51/PPO)
    priority: P4
    notes: Optimize bankroll directly using calibrated probabilities. Needs env simulation.

  # P5 - Online/Streaming Upgrades
  - id: online_incremental_training
    description: Implement Online Incremental Model Training
    priority: P5
    notes: Use sliding window to fine-tune daily/regularly for drift.
  - id: online_drift_alarms
    description: Implement Drift Alarms (e.g., KS-test on predictions)
    priority: P5
    notes: Monitor prediction distribution for significant changes.
  - id: online_shadow_validation
    description: Implement Shadow Validation Loop
    priority: P5
    notes: Continuously monitor live accuracy and trigger retraining if performance degrades.

    priority: P0
  - id: rolling_cv
    description: Implement Rolling Cross-Validation (TimeSeriesSplit, k-folds)
    priority: P1
    notes: Average metrics across folds, potentially adapt early stopping per fold.
  - id: optuna_hpo
    description: Add Hyperparameter Optimization (Optuna) with Rolling CV
    priority: P1
    depends_on: rolling_cv
    notes: Uses TimeSeriesSplit for more robust HPO evaluation.
