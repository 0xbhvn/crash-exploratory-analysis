# Data Preprocessing Requirement

**CRITICAL:** Before running any model training, validation, prediction, or analysis scripts, you **MUST** ensure the core data CSV is up-to-date.

Always execute the following command from the workspace root **first**:

```bash
python -m main --update_csv_only
```

This command is defined in [main.py](mdc:main.py).

This applies to scripts such as:
- `main.py` (when running training/prediction modes)
- `validate_model.py`
- `analyze_predictions.py`
- `replay_predictor.py`
- Any script performing analysis based on `games.csv` or derived data.

Failure to do this may result in using stale data.
