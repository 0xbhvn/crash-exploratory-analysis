# Always Activate Virtual Environment

Always check if the virtual environment is activated before running any terminal commands. The project uses a Python virtual environment located at `crash_env/` to manage dependencies.

## Activation Check

Before executing any terminal commands, check if the virtual environment is active by looking for the `(crash_env)` prefix in the terminal prompt. If it's not active, first activate it using the appropriate command for the user's shell.

## Activation Commands

### For bash/zsh (macOS/Linux):
```bash
source crash_env/bin/activate
```

### For Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
crash_env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### For Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
.\crash_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Example Usage

Instead of:
```bash
python main.py --input games.csv
```

First check if the environment is activated. If not, use:
```bash
source crash_env/bin/activate
python main.py --input games.csv
```

## Requirements

The virtual environment contains all the required dependencies:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- xgboost
- scikit-learn
- rich
- python-dotenv
- sqlalchemy
- psycopg2-binary

New dependencies should be installed within the virtual environment and added to `requirements.txt`.
